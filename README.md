This started as just me trying to duplicate the auth strategy I'm using on a couple of work projects, but ended up being a testing ground for me to learn Flummox + react-router v0.13 + ES6 React components. It's still a work-in-progress!

### Running

```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```
